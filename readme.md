## First Coding with Mosh
## Java note

Java was developed by james gosling

Function

specifie the return type

void is a return type that mean there will be no return value

name of the function (git is a descriptive name)

() parameter of a function

the actual java code is going into {} the braces

{ in java we put the { left brace in the same line as we define our function

main is the interpoint of the program

a class is a container for one or more related function

a method is a function part of a class

a function outside a class is just called function

access modifier (Public or private)

PascalNamingConvention == Classes  every first letter is uppercase

camelNamingConvention == Methods  the first letter is lowercase

int age = 30;

int type of variable, age is an identifier, =sign the assignment operator,30 initial value assign to the variable

with a coma we can declare multiple variable in the same line

single character single quote*'A'*multiple character multiple quote "AAA"

when dealing with reference type we should always allocate memories ex: Date now = new Date();

an object is an instance of a class

use array to store a list of object ex : *int [] numbers = {2,3,4,5,1,4};  Arrays.sort(numbers);*

2 dimensional arrays to store metrics 3 dimensional arrays to store data for cue

deepToString is use for printing multidimensional arrays

final float = constance: when we don't want the value to change

capital number to name all constance

Java has the same arithmetic operator as Math

in Java the division of 2 whole number is a whole number that's why it's necessary to convert the number to a float or a double

double result = (double)10 / (double)3;

increment operator example:* int x = 1;  x++;  =2*

augmented assignment operator ex : X += 2 to add 2 more to x

Java uses PEMDAS

Explicit casting example int y =*(int)x *+ 2; can only happen between compatible type like byte>short>int>long>float>double

integer.parseInt() take a string return it into integer

Math.random return a random number

NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance format number as currency

trim method to remove spaces

Mortgage calculator formula:  M = P r(1+r)n / (1+r)n-1 =
